iommu/amd: SVA Support (part 3) - refactor support for GCR3 table

This is part 3 of the 4-part series to introduce Share Virtual
Address (SVA) support, which focuses on refactoring GCR3 table.
This moves GCR3 related information from protection domain
structure to iommu_dev_data (per device) structure.

It contains the following enhancements:

* Patch 1 - 2:
  Rename helper function

* Patch 3 - 9:
  Introduce per device GCR3 table and code refactoring

* Patch 10:
  Remove unused variable from protection domain structure

This patch series is based on top of SVA Part 2 [1] :

Changes from v1 - v2:

    removed iommu_v2 module.
  - Moved Patch 'Use struct protection_domain in helper functions' from Part1 to
    Part3
  - Updated get_amd_iommu_from_dev() to retrieve iommu from device structure
  - Removed 'PD_MODE_PT'
