Subject: [PATCH] KVM: SVM: Ignore writes to Remote Read Data on AVIC write
 traps

Drop writes to APIC_RRR, a.k.a. Remote Read Data Register, on AVIC
unaccelerated write traps.  The register is read-only and isn't emulated
by KVM.  Sending the register through kvm_apic_write_nodecode() will
result in screaming when x2APIC is enabled due to the unexpected failure
to retrieve the MSR (KVM expects that only "legal" accesses will trap).

Fixes: 4d1d7942e36a ("KVM: SVM: Introduce logic to (de)activate x2AVIC mode")
